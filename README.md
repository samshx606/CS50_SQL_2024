# CS50 SQL Homework

This repository contains my solutions for the **CS50's Introduction to Computer Science** course, specifically focused on the SQL section. Each directory corresponds to a different problem set or section from the course. Below is an overview of the course structure and what each section contains.

## Sections

### 1. **Querying**
This section introduces basic SQL queries to retrieve data from a database. You will work with several tables, such as `cyberchase`, `players`, and `views`.

- **cyberchase.sql**: SQL queries related to the `cyberchase` dataset.
- **players.sql**: SQL queries related to the `players` dataset.
- **views.sql**: SQL queries related to the `views` dataset.

### 2. **Relating**
In this section, we learn to relate multiple tables using SQL joins and complex queries. The focus is on establishing relationships between different datasets, such as `moneyball` and `dese`.

- **dese.sql, moneyball.sql**: SQL queries involving tables in the `dese` and `moneyball` databases.
- **moneyball.db**: SQLite database for the "Moneyball" dataset.
- **log.sql**: Tracks actions performed on the database.
- **packages.db**: Another database for queries related to packages.
- **answers.txt**: Expected results or hints for solving SQL queries.

### 3. **Designing**
This section focuses on database design, creating the structure and relationships between tables.

- **atl.sql**: Queries related to the database design for the "ATL" project.
- **connect.sql**: Queries related to the database design for the "Connect" project.
- **donuts.sql**: Queries related to the database design for the "Donuts" project.

### 4. **Writing**
This section covers writing SQL queries to modify data in the database, such as inserts, updates, and deletes.

- **dont-panic.sql**: SQL queries for the "Don't Panic" project.
- **meteorites.sql**: SQL queries for the "Meteorites" project.

### 5. **Viewing**
In this section, we learn to present data from the database in meaningful ways using SQL.

- Queries for presenting data in a readable format using aggregation, filtering, and sorting.

### 6. **Optimizing**
This section focuses on improving SQL query performance by analyzing query execution plans and optimizing queries for larger datasets.

- **harvard.sql**: Optimized queries related to the Harvard dataset.
- **snap.sql**: Optimized queries related to the Snap dataset.

### 7. **Scaling**
This section teaches how to scale databases for larger applications and handle high-volume data.

- **connect.sql**: Queries related to scaling the "Connect" database.
- **deep.sql**: Queries related to scaling the "Deep" database.
- **dont-panic-python.sql**: Python-related scaling exercises for the "Don't Panic" project.

### Final Project
For the final project, I applied everything learned throughout the course to design and implement a fully functioning database system.

- **DBMS.sql**: The final database management system.
- **DESIGN.md**: Documentation for the database design, including the schema and relationships.
- **Diagram.png**: Visual representation of the database schema.
